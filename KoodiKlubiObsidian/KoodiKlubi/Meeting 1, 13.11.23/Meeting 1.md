At the first meeting, everyone will code a small program using the programming language of their choice. 

The program should be as simple as possible while also being sufficiently engaging to make. This is to evaluate the overall skill level of the group and helps us to plan future topics/exercises.

You can fill the Starting Survey Form before or during the first meeting. Duration of the meeting: 16:00 - 18:30

**Reminder**

The topic for each meeting is heavily dictated by the demand of the topic. In our Discord there is a "topics suggestion" text chat where you can rate an already made topic thread or make new topic threads. The thread with the most thumbs up will be chosen as the next week's topic

**Next week**

Next week's topic will probably be on Basic's of C++, Pointer

The goal of next week's meeting is to grasp the basics of pointers in C++
